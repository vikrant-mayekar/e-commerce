# AI-Powered Recommendation System Documentation

## Overview

Our e-commerce platform implements a sophisticated multi-agent recommendation system that leverages machine learning techniques to provide hyper-personalized product recommendations. The system analyzes user behaviors, preferences, and product characteristics to create a tailored shopping experience for each customer.

## Multi-agent AI System Architecture

The recommendation system consists of three primary agents working together:

### 1. User Agent
- **Purpose**: Tracks and analyzes user behavior and preferences
- **Implementation**: 
  - Monitors user interactions across the platform
  - Records product views, wishlist additions, and purchases
  - Builds user profiles based on interaction patterns
  - Models implemented in `users` app and `ProductView` tracking

### 2. Product Agent
- **Purpose**: Manages product relationships and similarities
- **Implementation**:
  - Analyzes product descriptions, categories, and attributes
  - Creates TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors for each product
  - Calculates similarity matrices between products
  - Identifies complementary and substitute products

### 3. Recommendation Agent
- **Purpose**: Combines multiple recommendation strategies to produce final suggestions
- **Implementation**:
  - Orchestrates the entire recommendation workflow
  - Integrates signals from User and Product agents
  - Balances different recommendation approaches
  - Delivers final personalized product suggestions

## Machine Learning Components

### TF-IDF Vectorization
- Located in `recommendations/recommender.py`
- Converts product text descriptions into numerical vectors
- Uses sklearn's `TfidfVectorizer` to transform text data
- Enables content-based similarity calculations

```python
self.vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
...
tfidf_matrix = self.vectorizer.fit_transform(descriptions)
```

### Cosine Similarity Matrix
- Used for both user-to-user and product-to-product similarity calculations
- Implemented with `sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity`
- Efficiently identifies relationships in high-dimensional spaces

```python
product_similarity = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix)
user_similarity = cosine_similarity(matrix)
```

### Recommendation Algorithms

#### 1. Collaborative Filtering
- **Type**: User-based collaborative filtering
- **Purpose**: Recommends products based on similar users' preferences
- **Implementation**:
  - Creates user-product interaction matrix
  - Calculates similarity between users
  - Finds products liked by similar users but not yet seen by the target user
  - Located in `recommendations/recommender.py`

#### 2. Content-Based Filtering
- **Purpose**: Recommends products similar to those the user has shown interest in
- **Implementation**:
  - Uses product descriptions to calculate product similarity
  - Analyzes user's viewed/purchased products
  - Recommends similar products based on content features
  - Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity for content matching

#### 3. Hybrid Approach
- **Purpose**: Combines strengths of both collaborative and content-based recommendations
- **Implementation**:
  - Generates recommendations from both approaches
  - Deduplicates and ranks combined recommendations
  - Provides a more robust and diverse set of recommendations

```python
def generate_recommendations(self, user_id, n_recommendations=5):
    """Generate hybrid recommendations"""
    collab_recs = self.collaborative_filtering(user_id, n_recommendations)
    content_recs = self.content_based_filtering(user_id, n_recommendations)
    
    # Combine and deduplicate recommendations
    all_recs = {}
    for product, score in collab_recs + content_recs:
        if product.id not in all_recs or score > all_recs[product.id][1]:
            all_recs[product.id] = (product, score)
    
    # Sort by score and return top n
    recommendations = sorted(all_recs.values(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return recommendations[:n_recommendations]
```

## Data Collection and Storage

### User Interaction Tracking
- **ProductView Model**: Records when users view products
- **Wishlist Model**: Tracks products users save for later
- **PurchaseHistory Model**: Records completed purchases
- These models create a comprehensive view of user behavior

### User Preferences
- **UserPreferences Model**:
  - Stores user's category preferences
  - Maintains price range preferences
  - Updates dynamically based on user behavior

### Long-Term Memory
- All user data, preferences, and interactions are stored in SQLite database
- Models define relationships between users, products, and interactions
- System can retrieve historical data to improve future recommendations

## Intelligent Analysis

### User Behavior Analysis
- Analyzes patterns in user browsing and purchasing behavior
- Identifies products frequently viewed or purchased together
- Calculates user similarity based on interaction patterns

### Product Relationship Analysis
- Creates product similarity matrices based on content
- Identifies complementary products
- Groups products by feature similarity

## Integration with E-commerce Platform

The recommendation system is fully integrated with the e-commerce platform:

- **Product Detail Views**: Show personalized recommendations
- **User Dashboard**: Displays tailored product suggestions
- **Wishlist Management**: Learns from user's saved items
- **Purchase Tracking**: Improves recommendations based on actual purchases

## Future Enhancements

- Implement session-based recommendations for non-logged-in users
- Add time decay to give more weight to recent interactions
- Incorporate explicit user ratings and reviews
- Develop A/B testing framework to evaluate recommendation effectiveness
